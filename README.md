# Classifying Children and Adults in Unseen Data from Resting State fMRI


### Data Preprocessing

- Data preprocessing involved the transformation of the dataset, resulting in the creation of two classes: 'adult' and 'child'.

### Model Training and Testing

- The model was trained on 124 samples and tested on 31 samples.
- After extensive hyperparameter tuning, the best SVM model achieved an accuracy of approximately 93.55% on the test data.

### Conclusion

In this project, we aimed to predict age groups ('adult' or 'child') based on resting state fMRI data. After thorough data preprocessing and model training, our Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier demonstrated impressive performance. With an accuracy of approximately 93.55% on the test data, the model successfully distinguished between adults and children based on fMRI patterns.

These results suggest that resting state fMRI data can be a valuable resource for age prediction. Further research and applications in this domain could have significant implications for understanding brain development and age-related changes in neural activity.
